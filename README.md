# Bike-Sharing-System-Data-Exploration
This data set contains information regarding individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. It contains information including duration of ride, start and end time of ride, where the ride started and ended, the longitude and latitude, station ID, bike ID, type of user, year of birth, gender, and whether user shares for all trip. This data set gives the opprotunity to explore relationships between different variables to come up with meaningful insights. I converted data type for start_time and end_time to datetime, as well as member_birth_year to int. I filled all missing values as required, calculated distances between the stations for each trip using the longitudes and latitudes, got the times of the day and day of the week for each trip, and categorized the year of births to generations.

## Summary of Findings

No customer shared bike while the majority of the subscribers also did not share. Members whose gender is missing spent more time on the average, followed by those whose gender was 'other than male and female'. Females spent more time than male. In terms of distance between start station and end station, 'female' and 'other' genders spent more time. Trips that started on Wednesday and ended on Thursday, and from morning to early morning involved more distance and time. I am bringing these into the explanatory phase.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the distance travelled and time as related to bike sharing, type of user, gender, parts of the day, days of the week and generations. I start by introducing bike sharing based on user type, gender and generations, followed by the average distance covered and time spent by subscribers and customers, different genders, on different days of the week, in parts of the day, and among baby boomers.
